## **Project implementation**

This project was a training one, in order to see the work of the Vite project assembler on its
example, work with the tailwind css framework and figure out the benefits that postCSS gives. The
basis of the project is an html-document with a static layout. It implement login form, which is
styled with tailwind css. With the help of html attributes, classes and javascript, validation is
implemented for filling out the form and warning about incorrect filling. The project code has been
formatted with ESLint and Prettier for cleanliness. The .css and .js files in the dist folder are
reduced in size, the autoprefixer plugin was used for cross-browser compatibility.
